# Excel Learning Journey

This repository contains my growing collection of Excel projects, exercises, and real-world practice.  
My goal is to build strong skills in:

- Data cleaning and preparation  
- Workbook and worksheet organization  
- Formatting and layout design  
- Excel formulas and shortcuts  
- PDF reporting  
- Microsoft Copilot automation  
- Professional documentation  

Each project lives in its own folder with the Excel files, PDF exports, screenshots, and a project-specific README.
